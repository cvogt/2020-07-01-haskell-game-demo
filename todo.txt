TODO brainstorming:

1. milestone:

coordinate system
- graceful operation when resizing the window / full screen. I.e. scaling the pixel
- modular coordinate system, where something consisting of multiple thing can exist rotated within another (e.g. a spaceship rotated inside of a non rotated grid representing space)
- pathfinding
- collision detection during movement when walking around
- onclick events (also with overlapping assets)
- some sort of menu

2. milestone
- take individual images from files containing multiple images
- take animations from image files containing the individual images
- how to handle multi coodinate visual effects




CREATTIVE IDEAS:
generted music:
- auto-generate music and make user optionally involved in creative process
- craft building blocks affecting music or use minerals
- correlate what happens in the music with what happens in the game, e.g. danger
- have music related rooms, e.g. a mixing or synth room.
- have disco-lighting for the space ship

usefulness of stuff:
- maybe not fly spaceship directly but put it on course and then have to pass the time until arrival
- pass time until arrival in bed / cryopod / playing with the music / doing other stuff on board. NO MINIGAMES unless super cool.

main character:
- humantiy has dies, main character is a robot but with personality, has to find out what happened, find blueprints for new chips and modules as game progresses, maybe some related to music or speech synthesis

spaceship building:
- need air and have a hull integrity system similar to subnautica leading to intersting designs and danger

planet art style:
- maybe planets are actually 3d spheres of 2d tiles you can look at as you approach and when you get close enough to walk it is so large it's just a plane

titles:
- musicminer, musebot, museminer, left in space (wakes up as emergency repair bot after incident)
